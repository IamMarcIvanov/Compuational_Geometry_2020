# Assignment 1 - Convex Hull
Our Algorithms - 
1. Graham's Algorithm (Aryan)
2. Jarvis March / Gift-wrapping Algorithm (Arpan)
3. Andrew's Algorithm (Danish) :==
    Currently I have used a point class and a line class (though it is not currently necessary). I was unable to put the various classes in separate files. I have also                       yet to handle degenerate cases. Currently, only integer coordinate poits are accepted.
4. Quickhull (Arpan)
5. Preparata / Divide and Conquer Algorithm (Aryan)
6. Chan's Algorithm (Danish)

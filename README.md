# Assignment 1 - Convex Hull
Our Algorithms - 
1. Graham's Algorithm
2. Jarvis March / Gift-wrapping Algorithm
3. Andrew's Algorithm :=
    Currently I have used a point class and a line class (though it is not currently necessary). I was unable to put the various classes in separate files. I have also                       yet to handle degenerate cases. Currently, only integer coordinate poits are accepted.
4. Quickhull
5. Preparata / Divide and Conquer Algorithm
6. Chan's Algorithm
